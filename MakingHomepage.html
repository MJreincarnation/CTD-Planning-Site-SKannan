    <h1> Working on My Homepage Site </h1>

    <p> Summary of Homepage Site: This webpage is intended to document my process of brainstorming and creating a homepage. </br>
                                  It displays my wireframes and storyboard in order of progression during the process. </li>
        <h2> Made my Wireframe version for Homepage </h2>
                <ol>
                  <li> Created my wireframe <img src="Wireframe.png" width="400px" /> </li>
                  <li> Voted Miffy's layout as the best </li>
                  <li> Created it in fireworks </li>
                  <li> Chose to include logo, video, description, and subpage links </li>
                </ol>

                <h2> Made my Storyboard version for Homepage </h2>
                  <ol>
                    <li> Everyone creates their own storyboard and then we compare  </li>
                    <li> Storyboard Rough Draft 1</li>
                    <img src="Storyboard.png" width="400px" />
                  </ol>

                <li> Storyboard</li>
                <ol>
                  <li> <a href="FinalPages/index-FW.htm"> Storyboard in Fireworks</a> </li>
                  <li> <a href="FinalPages/index-DW.html"> Storyboard in Dreamweaver</a> </li>
                </ol>

                  <h2> Working in Fireworks vs Working in Dreamweaver </h2>
                  <ol>
                    <li> Working in Fireworks is easy and can be done without any confusion because it has very simple fucntions </li>
                    <li> Working in Dreamweaver is slightly more complicated as the it has very few tools that are similar with fireworks <li>
                    <li> I did not struggle with Fireworks too much as Mr. Chu explained it fairly clearly and because it was quite similar to photoshop. We had been using fireworks for many things throughout the year and so it was easier for me </li>
                    <li> I am struggling a lot with my dreamweaver because the interface is completely different and I do not feel that the transition from fireworks to this was too smooth. I have already encountered numerous problems, such as fixing the size of the div, and etc., but I will pull through by doing research. </li>
                  </ol>

                  <h2> Obstacles </h2>
                    <ol>
                      <li> Did not know how to change the CSS style sheet of each div </li>
                        <p> Miffy taught me how to do it by telling me to select the box and clicking "New CSS rule" located in properties </p>
                      <li> Had a problem with adjusting the size of the logo to match with the size in Fireworks </li>
                        <p> Miffy helped me again by telling me to adjust the size of the imported image rather than altering the div box </p>
                    </ol>

                  <h2> Made my version of the sub-Wireframe </br>
                       Note: Red = Constant. Blue = Variable  </h2>
                    <ol>
                      <img src="subWireframe.png" width="400px" />

                      <li> The most notable feature will be the navigation bar as it will be customized to wrap open to the left (hopefully) </li>
                      <li> It will also contain small arrows at the bottom to direct to the next page </li>
                      <li> All the content will be displayed in the big box. Features of this will be presented in the storyboard version </li>
                    </ol>
