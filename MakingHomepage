                  <li> Working in Fireworks vs Working in Dreamweaver </li>
                  <ol>
                    <li> Working in Fireworks is easy and can be done without any confusion because it has very simple fucntions </li>
                    <li> Working in Dreamweaver is slightly more complicated as the it has very few tools that are similar with fireworks <li>
                    <li> I did not struggle with Fireworks too much as Mr. Chu explained it fairly clearly and because it was quite similar to photoshop. We had been using fireworks for many things throughout the year and so it was easier for me </li>
                    <li> I am struggling a lot with my dreamweaver because the interface is completely different and I do not feel that the transition from fireworks to this was too smooth. I have already encountered numerous problems, such as fixing the size of the div, and etc., but I will pull through by doing research. </li>
